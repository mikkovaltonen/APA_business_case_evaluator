| This Policy describes the operative decision-making authorities for the X; hence it applies to all group companies. To duly contain X’s business risks and cater for profitability, it is vital that all operative decisions are made applying this Policy.                                                                                                             | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Decision-making in X is structured on the basis of the Group's operative organization. As a general rule, X's businesses are accountable for their own activities. In addition to X's operative rules, decision-making will be subject to any applicable company laws. Delegation of authority is permissible in the instances defined the CEO and L1 views of the DMA. | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| As a rule, most operative decisions are taken within each business unit and in accordance with the operating plan of that unit. Deviations from the operating plan are typically decided on by the relevant L1. Certain significant decisions, however, are vested in the CEO/CFO level.                                                                                | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
