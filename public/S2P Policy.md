# PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES {#principles-and-objectives .No.-Heading-1-(Alt+Ctrl+1)}

## Segregation of Duties {#segregation-of-duties .No.-Heading-2-(Alt+Ctrl+2)}

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that all Source to Pay processes and
procedures are constructed in a way that no single individual or team
can control the whole process.

### Requirements

- To ensure segregation of duties we must always keep a clear separation
  between the defining of our needs, financial approval of the costs,
  the selection and onboarding of suppliers, and the payment of
  invoices.

- The segregation of duties and approval rights shall be reflected
  throughout the Source to Pay processes, including IT systems and
  delegation rights.

## Purchasing {#purchasing .No.-Heading-2-(Alt+Ctrl+2)}

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that X employees spend X money in a smart and
responsible way.

### Requirements

- Alternatives to purchasing shall always be considered, such as using
  internal resources or challenging specifications.

- Already approved and managed suppliers and contracts shall be used
  when possible.

- Appropriate time shall be planned for the purchasing activities to
  ensure an optimal outcome to X and compliance to Source to Pay
  processes.

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that purchase requests are managed and
approved in a controlled and governed way in X.

### Requirements

- The stakeholder that has a need to purchase shall, in reasonable time
  before delivery, create a Purchase Request. The purchase request shall
  be approved according to the financial Decision Making Authority (DMA)
  rule, as decided by the Board of Directors.

- A Purchase Order issued from approved purchase tools is the Standard
  Purchase Method in X. When standard purchase method and tools cannot
  be used, the CPO or as delegated can design and implement an
  alternative purchase method.

- There shall not be any verbal or written commitments made to the
  supplier before the purchase order is fully approved.

- Minor, low risk purchases, as described in the Source to Pay process
  description, may be purchased as an expense or with invoice only.

## Sourcing and Contract Management {#sourcing-and-contract-management .No.-Heading-2-(Alt+Ctrl+2)}

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that we select suppliers with the ability to
meet X requirements and to support us in reaching our goals while
minimizing and controlling risks.

### Requirements

- X shall use a competitive sourcing approach to source goods and
  services. Exception from competitive sourcing approach can be approved
  by CPO or as delegated. As a general rule, the competitive bidding
  threshold is 100 kâ‚¬.

- For business-critical supply, X shall avoid single source to maintain
  competition and reduce risks. Single source of business-critical
  supply can be approved by CPO or as delegated.

- Supplier evaluation and selection shall be made by balancing a
  combination of total cost of ownership, functional fit, and total risk
  exposure (e.g. privacy, security, supplier code of conduct, financial
  stability, delivery).

- Supplier selection shall be based on transparent and objective
  criteria, free from personal interests, biases, or other untoward or
  political influences. Also, suppliers should not be economically
  harmed by being invited to a selection process without a realistic
  chance of winning the contract. Countertrade (reciprocal) deals are
  not supported.

- The final decision to award the business to the selected supplier(s)
  is made together by the persons responsible for making the financial
  commitment and the sourcing person responsible for the sourcing case.
  For clarity: if those persons disagree, the selection is escalated to
  their line managers, until a unanimous decision is reached, by the
  group CEO if necessary.

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that X has written and mutually agreed
contracts with our suppliers to define deliverables, responsibilities
and liabilities, help secure social commitments, compliance and manage
risk.

### Requirements

- X standard contract templates should be used to formalize contracts
  with suppliers. X standard contract templates shall be approved by the
  legal function. Deviations from X standard contract templates shall be
  kept to a minimum and need to be approved by CPO or as delegated.

- All signed contracts with Suppliers shall be dual signed by CPO or as
  delegated, together with stakeholder representative that has the
  Decision Making Authority to approve the cost and risks. Note: in some
  countries a Power of Attorney for the legal entity is also required.
  Exceptions to dual signing are defined by CPO or as delegated.

- As defined by Sourcing, an unsigned purchase order referencing the
  standard terms and conditions can be used as the written contract.
  These implied contract terms do not give the same clarity in dispute
  cases but can be used in cases with no significant risks.

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that X only engages with suppliers who meet
our standards for responsible supply and who also require the same
standards from their own suppliers.

### Requirements

Before contracting a new supplier, the supplier must be evaluated in the
supplier risk assessment process through which we validate that the
supplier respect and complies with all applicable requirements in areas
such as sanctions, health, privacy and security, environmental,
employment and fiscal regulations.

- A risk-based approach is used to steer the level of risk assessment
  required.

- All contracted suppliers to X shall comply with X Supplier Code of
  Conduct. Exceptions to the Supplier Code of Conduct requirements can
  be approved by CPO or as delegated.

- For minor, low risk vendors, where the purchasing happens without a
  signed contract, e.g. with a purchase order referencing to the general
  terms and conditions, or as expenses or with an invoice only, the
  supplier evaluation procedures shall ensure a minimum level of post
  purchase validation.

### 

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that all kind of confidential information is
kept safe and protected at all times.

### Requirement

A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or other contract protecting
confidential information, shall be in place before any confidential
information can be shared between X and any Supplier.

## Sourcing Category and Supplier Management {#sourcing-category-and-supplier-management .No.-Heading-2-(Alt+Ctrl+2)}

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that X uses sourcing category management
practises to focus opportunities for consolidation, effectiveness,
efficiency, and limitation of risk where there is most impact.

### Requirements

- Different sourcing categories shall be defined based on
  characteristics of the supply.

- Category Strategies and Plans shall be developed in close
  collaboration with relevant stakeholders and approved based on X
  Category Management Framework.

- The level of detail and the effort required are scaled to the
  potential commercial opportunities and risks in each sourcing
  category.

### Objective

The objective is to ensure that the supplier base is continuously
managed to maximize value, minimize waste and limit X risk exposure.

### Requirements

- Our suppliers shall be segmented, and activities performed according
  to X Supplier Management Framework.

- Supplier performance shall be continuously monitored and supplier
  relationships developed, based on the supplier segmentation. Main
  efforts shall be directed towards suppliers which hold the highest
  impact, strategic importance and/or risk.

- Supply and supplier risks shall be regularly assessed based on the
  supplier segmentation and be recorded together with planned mitigating
  activities.

# BREACHES AGAINST THE INSTRUCTION {#breaches-against-the-instruction .No.-Heading-1-(Alt+Ctrl+1)}
