#  Introduction

This document provides an overview and detailed descriptions of all the
different operational purchasing variants within X.

# Terminology

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Term**              **Short description**
  --------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  Balancing             Checking of the equality of accounts between X
                        and the supplier.

  Catalogue             Catalogues are primary lists of most commonly
                        requested items in XShop. Catalog contains a list
                        of purchase items including the required basic
                        data of the item, such as the description of the

                        XShop by filling in the designated data fields
                        describing the required purchase item.

  Non-PO purchase       A commercial purchase transaction, which has been
                        made without establishing a purchase order.

  Operational           Refers to activities, which manage the
  purchasing            transactional elements of purchasing meaning from
                        purchase request to invoicing.

# Overview of the operational purchasing process

## Architecture

The operational purchasing process architecture consists of four (4)
primary process variants.

1.  XShop purchase process

- Catalogue and non-catalogue purchasing including subcontracting that
  are conducted via XShop

2.  Recurring contract based purchase process

- Certain recurring contract based purchases, e.g. subscriptions, rents,
  insurance, energy and service level agreements for cleaning, reception
  services, and facility management that are based on agreements.

3.  Low value purchase process

- Low value purchases (worth less than 50 euros) that are handled with
  personal employee credit card.

4.  Travel purchase process

- Business travel purchases that are conducted primarily via the agreed
  tools and services.

Operational purchasing process architecture includes also a non-PO
purchase process. However, this process variant is to be followed only
during unexpected emergencies when the four primary process variants
above are inadequate.

Operational purchasing process variants are based on seven (7) different
generic activities:

# Process variants

## XShop

### Introduction

XShop purchase process variant refers to the catalogue and non-catalogue
purchasing and subcontracting conducted via XShop. XShop is the
mandatory tool for Request to Purchase in countries where it has been
implemented.

Until XShop usage coverage is X wide, there are also two other purchase
systems (Jira and Remedy) in use for limited purchase areas.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key process steps

### XShop purchase variants

> Link to Y and XShop is found in the intranet. A purchase requisition
> shall be submitted in XShop for categories available in the tool.
> Those categories are defined in Procurement Corner (intra).
>
> Further guidelines and processes for XShop purchase variant are found
> in the WWW.

#### Catalogue purchase

The end-user logs in into XShop using personal log in details provided.

When creating a Purchase Request in XShop it is mandatory to use
products/ services available in the catalogues. If a product/ service is
not available in the catalogue, a Non-Catalogue Request shall be
submitted.

The purchase request is approved according to the company approval limit
policies.

####  Non-catalogue purchase

If a product/ service is not available in the catalogues, a
Non-Catalogue Request shall be submitted as a "free text" order by
filling in the designated data fields describing the required purchase
item in XShop. The purchase request is approved according to the company
approval limits policies.

#### Subcontracting (staffing) purchase

> Subcontracting need is identified and requested by a project manager.
> Internal resources are primarily used to fulfill the requested needs.
> If no suitable internal resource is found, the resource request is
> forwarded to a Staffing Manager who creates a request in XShop. The
> Staffing Manager is responsible for finding a suitable external
> resource. The original requestor, the project manager, approves the
> resource recommended by the Staffing Manager. After the approval the
> Staffing Manager makes the Purchase Order (PO).
>
> For subcontracting purchases there is a specific defined subprocess in
> the
>
> Purchase Request to Receive Process. It is linked to and the purchases
> are initiated by Staffing Process.

## Recurring contract based purchases 

### Introduction

Certain recurring contract based purchases are not ordered nor managed
via XShop. These purchases are based on different types of contracts
(such as service level agreements, annual contracts and lease
agreements).

Typically these types of purchases are subscriptions, rents, insurance,
energy and service level agreements for such as cleaning, reception
services, and facility management.

For an individual purchase transaction there are no requestor or
approver roles needed. Requestor initiates the contract need but does
not need to initiate the individual transactions, which are based on the
contract.

Invoices of these purchases are approved according to the applicable
invoice approval guidelines.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key process steps

In recurring contract based purchasing the role of strategic procurement
is emphasized as the main focus is in defining the purchase content,
selecting the right supplier and entering to a contractual relation.

In this process variant the focus is in ensuring that the invoicing
matches the agreed contract terms and content. There are three differing
ways to purchase recurring contract based goods and services.

### Recurring contract based purchase variants

Recurring contract based purchasing consists of three different process
variants according to the approval needs and the end-user types. The
variants are the following:

1.  Recurring contract based purchases that require an approval of the
    purchase request according to the approval rights and individual
    service instructions (e.g. lease cars and training).

2.  Recurring contract based purchases that are available for X
    employees without the need to have a purchase request approval, i.e.
    the service is available based on the individual service
    instructions (e.g. health care and office supplies).

3.  Recurring contract based purchases that have a specified stakeholder
    group as the requestor, i.e. individual X employee does not need to
    create a request for these goods and services. These types of
    purchases typically refer to infrastructure and common goods like
    electricity, insurance and cleaning services.

## Low value purchases

### Introduction

Low value purchases (worth less than 50 euros) can be handled with
personal employee credit card or with cash if the requested item is not
supplied in XShop or by a contract supplier.

> Credit card and cash purchases must have an approval. Expense claims
> are made against the receipt of the purchase.

Credit cards are issued according to the Global Credit Card Policy.
Compensation of credit card usage with expense report is based on a
separate process.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key process steps

First the requestor checks whether the requested item is available in
XShop or supplied by a contract supplier. If the item is not offered in
the catalogues or by a contract supplier and the item is worth less than
50 euros, the requested item can be purchased with cash or credit card.

The recommended way is that the requestor gets an approval for the low
value purchase according to the company approval limit policies. If the
purchase requested is approved, the requestor pays the purchase with
credit card or cash, and stores the receipt.

The requestor makes an expense claim according to the Global Credit Card
Policy.

damages can be prevented due immediate actions taken and follow-up of
the non-PO purchase variant, an approval is not mandatory prior the
purchase.

# Governance and KPIs

All X employees are responsible to follow these process variants
described. In addition line managers are responsible to control that
employees follow the defined processes.

Persons with budgetary responsibilities follow and control the
accumulation of expenditures and costs. Finance and control follows the
expenditures and budget limits.

Procurement has the role to support and manage the operational
purchasing processes. This includes KPI follow up and reporting within
Procurement and to relevant stakeholders.

Procurement actively cooperates with the Accounts Payable to ensure the
required performance through the procure to pay process.

Below, the currently used KPIs, which are part of the Procurement
dashboard. KPIs are continuously further developed.
